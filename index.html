          <p>Hello, I'm <span class="colorful">Ashley Kang</span> (she/her)! I use coding and knowledge sharing to explore questions about how to secure technologies and to make security more usable. These days, I'm working on a M.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity and scheming with <a href="https://colorcoded.la" target="_blank">Color Coded Collective</a>.</p>
          <p>My Summer 2020 security engineering internship has been canceled as a response to the pandemic, so I'd love to be in touch about new software and security engineering opportunities to work on usable security products!</p>
          <p>Into: Security/privacy, accessibility, zines, diasporic foodways, student and community radio, mediocre rom coms</p>
