          <p>Hello world, I'm <span class="colorful">Ashley Kang</span>! I use design, code, and research to explore questions about how to make the secure thing easier to do as a senior security engineer building security UX. I love a coffee shop by day turned wine bar by night, care too much about skincare, and picked up surfskating (<a href="https://www.grlswirl.com" target="_blank">GRLSWIRL</a> <3) while rebuilding my life.</p>
          </ul>
          <p>I have a MS in computer science (proud <a href="https://osscsuf.org/" target="_blank">Offensive Security Society</a> alum!) and a BA in a self-designed liberal arts concentration in art, media studies, and computer science. I have a range of training and experience in:
          <ul>
            <li>Technology consulting: Web development, UI/UX design, web accessibility</li>
            <li>Security engineering: Product security, cloud platform security</li>
            <li>Security consulting: Application security, penetration testing</li>
            <li>Security research: Malware analysis, cyber threat intelligence</li>
          </ul>
          I'm always open to learning about full-time opportunities in these areas that facilitate remote work, work-life balance, and sponsorship + mentorship.</p>
