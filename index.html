          <p>Hello! I'm <span class="colorful">Ashley Kang</span> (she/her). I use design, code, and pedagogy to ask questions and build narratives that connect people, culture, and information.</p>
          <p>As a teen on Tumblr, NYU Gallatin undergrad, public and after school educator, intern at a creative technology startup, tech apprentice, remote web design and dev consultant, and Square Code Camper, I've been convinced the coolest thing is to learn how to use technologies to discover and pursue what you care about. These days, I'm taking postbac coursework in computer science, tutoring youth after school, and working as a university marketing team's first web developer fellow. Ask me about designing my own interdisciplinary major in Visual + Digital Culture and being part of a technology learning collective known as <a href="https://colorcoded.la" target="_blank">Color Coded</a>.</p>
          <p>Into: Accessibility, privacy, imagemaking, zines, diasporic foodways, mediocre rom coms</p>
