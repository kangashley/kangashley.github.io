          <p>Hello world, I'm <span class="colorful">Ashley Kang</span>! I use design, code, and research to explore questions about how to make the secure thing easier to do. You may catch me lounging with a book and emotional support beverage, caring too much about skincare (get your K-beauty @ Costco!) and home decor, or getting injured while surfskating (<a href="https://www.grlswirl.com" target="_blank">GRLSWIRL</a> <3).</p>
          </ul>
          <p>I have a MS in computer science (proud <a href="https://osscsuf.org/" target="_blank">Offensive Security Society</a> alum!) and a BA in a self-designed liberal arts concentration in art, media studies, and computer science. I bring an interdisplinary portfolio of training and experience in:
          <ul>
            <li>Technology consulting: Web development, UI/UX design, web accessibility</li>
            <li>Security engineering: Product security, platform security</li>
            <li>Security consulting: Application security, penetration testing</li>
            <li>Security research: Malware analysis, cyber threat intelligence</li>
          </ul>
          I'm always open to learning about full-time opportunities in these areas that facilitate remote work, work-life balance, and sponsorship + mentorship.</p>

          <h2 class="colorful">p5.js Showcase</h2>
          <p>Purpose: <em>How might we showcase a project to increase access to the open source p5.js library and inspire others to contribute to Processing's creative coding community?</em></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Researched existing examples of community-based project showcases, organized research on how p5.js is used in the wild into categories of p5.js contributions, and established a straightforward form-based process for creators to nominate a project for the Showcase
            <li>Designed <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/WkRoMv5Nf9yzzzwY7cz2JbbR/p5.js-Showcase" target="_blank">wireframes</a>, created a <a href="https://codepen.io/kangashley/pen/RXGKyX" target="_blank">prototype</a>, and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Node.js templating to support internationalization</li>
            <li>Curated 6 projects (out of 60+) and interviewed their creators (out of 5+ million users!) about their groundbreaking process of using p5.js to explore art and design concepts and mediums, p5.js libraries and other technologies, or ways of learning and teaching: Roni Cantor, Yona Ngo, Dae In Chung, Casey Conchinha + Louise Less√©l, Moon Jang + Xin Xin's UGA students, Qianqian Ye</li>
            <li>Advocated for an accessibility review, leading to a site-wide audit enagagement with accessibility subject matter experts Sina Bahram and Claire Kearney-Volpe and a code refactor with mentor Kate Hollenbach and p5.js creator Lauren Lee McCarthy</li>
