          <p>Hello, I'm <span class="colorful">Ashley Kang</span>! I use design, code, and research to explore questions about how to make the secure thing easier to do. Currently, I work as a security engineer on a platform security team with a current focus in building and maintaining security tools for internal authentication, authorization, and IAM/IGA. I dig coffee, skincare (here's <a href="https://ashleykang.notion.site/ashleykang/skincare-routine-c1fd69a6caab4a03a2679f4da23ef62f" target="_blank">my routine</a>!), skateboarding, the superpower of being interdisciplinary, and miscellaneous scheming (check out the <a href="https://asianfooddictionary.com/" target="_blank">Asian Food Dictionary</a> that I helped start in 2018!).</p>
          </ul>
          <p>I have a MS in computer science (proud <a href="https://osscsuf.org/" target="_blank">Offensive Security Society</a> alum!) and a BA in a self-designed liberal arts concentration in art, media studies, and computer science. During grad school, I worked on client and in-house projects with a collective of artists, educators, and technologists, then pivoted to cybersecurity by self-designing a rotational program—resulting in a range of training and experience in:
          <ul>
            <li>Technology consulting (web development, UI/UX design, web accessibility)</li>
            <li>Security engineering (product security, cloud platform/infrastructure security)</li>
            <li>Security consulting (application security, penetration testing)</li>
            <li>Security research (malware analysis, cyber threat intelligence)</li>
          </ul>
          I am always open to learning about opportunities in these areas that facilitate remote work, work-life balance, and sponsorship + mentorship.</p>
          <p>P.S. If you're interested in cybersecurity but aren't sure where to start, here's a <a href="https://kangashley.notion.site/Making-moves-as-a-cybersecurity-professional-5910832d9249466cb3f4313dea6ecd95" target="_blank">blog post</a> I wrote! The point is that there is no single path into cybersecurity, which makes the hacker community so special.</p>

          <p>Purpose: <em>How might we showcase a p5.js project to increase access to the open source JavaScript library and inspire others to contribute to the Processing community in many different ways?</em></p>
          <p>Solution: <a href="https://p5js.org/showcase/" target="_blank">p5js.org/showcase</a> &mdash; A Google Summer of Code 2019 project to create a new 6-part section on the p5.js documentation website that showcases creative and inclusive uses of p5.js and encourages project nominations; officially released in February 2020 with p5.js version 1.0 and expanded in summer 2020</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Researched community showcase examples and 60+ creators working with p5.js, organized research into types of p5.js contributions, and established a form-based process for creators to nominate a project of their own or by others
